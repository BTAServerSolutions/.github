# A collection of server mods for [Minecraft: Better than Adventure!](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/)

Whether you're looking for chest shops, InvSee, or even a nice steel block elevator, we should have something for you!

## [BTAServerUtilities](https://github.com/BTAServerSolutions/BTAServerUtilities)
...is the main mod. It was originally created as an utility mod for MelonBTA ([MelonCommands](https://github.com/BTAServerSolutions/melon-commands-deprecated-)) before being merged with
[GoldenAge's](https://goldenage-smp.org) utility mod Omnimod. Includes:
* Roles
* Kits
* Container Locking
* Player Info commands
* InvSee
* Vanish
* Homes and Warps
* Chest Shops
* Freezing players
* Block Inspection
* A detailed config for modifiying all of this

## [BTADiscordIntegration](https://github.com/BTAServerSolutions/BTADiscordIntegration)
...provides a bridge between a Discord server channel and a BTA server chat. You get Discord messages when players join
the server, die and send messages in the server chat

## [BTAServerGUILib](https://github.com/BTAServerSolutions/BTAServerGUILib)
...gives you the ability to add dialogues and other GUIs to your BTA server. **VERY WIP AT THE MOMENT**
